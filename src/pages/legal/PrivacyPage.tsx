      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="updated">Last updated: May 30, 2026</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Top Pocket Decks ("we", "us", or the
        "site"), available at pocketdecks.top, collects, uses, and shares
        information when you use the site. By using the site you agree to the
        practices described here.
      </p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage data.</strong> We use Google Analytics to understand how
          visitors use the site (for example pages viewed, approximate location,
          device type, and referring source). This data is aggregated and is not
          used to personally identify you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account information.</strong> If you sign in with Google, we
          receive basic profile information (your name, email address, and
          profile photo) through Firebase Authentication so we can provide your
          account and Premium features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment information.</strong> Premium subscriptions are
          processed by Stripe. Payments are handled entirely by Stripe and we do
          not receive or store your full card details.

      </ul>
