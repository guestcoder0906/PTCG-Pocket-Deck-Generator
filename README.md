## Overview

This npm package provides a database of Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket cards and sets (Pokemon TCG Pocket).
It includes multiples JSON files:

- `cards.json` which contains [basic informations](#cards) about the cards,
- `cards.extra.json` which contains [detailed informations](#cards-extra) about the cards,
- `cards.min.json` which contains [basic informations](#cards) about the cards, but minified to save bandwidth (~25% smaller),
- `cards.no-image.min.json` which contains [basic informations](#cards) about the cards without image name (~50% smaller),
- `sets.json` which contains all sets grouped by Series (A, B, …),
- `rarities.json` for informations about [rarity codes](#rarities) and cost,
- `pullRates.json` for informations with all statistics about the pull rates of the cards.

Cards are also available as sets separated JSON files in `cards/` folder (e.g. `dist/cards/A1a.json` or `dist/cards/A1a.min.json`).

- `set`: The set code of the card.
- `number`: The card number within the set.
- `name`: English name of the card.
- `rarity`: The rarity code of the card (see [rarities.json](#rarities) for labels).
- `image`: The name of the card image file (more details in [images](#images)).
- `packs`: An array of packs where the card can be found.

#### Cards Extra

The `cards.extra.json` file contains an array of card objects, each with the following properties:

- `set`: The set code of the card.

- `retreatCost`: The retreat cost of the card (if applicable).
- `weakness`: The weakness of the card (if applicable).

#### Rarities

The file `rarities.json` contains :

- `label` (see bellow),
- `image`: The image name of the rarity illustration (like "diamond.webp"),
- `count`: Number of times the image is repeated,
- `group`: Helper to group rarities (ex. "Diamond" category),
- `tradeable`: `true` or `false`, if trade is allowed for this rarity,

#### Sets

The file `sets.json` is not an array, but an object with Series names as keys, and arrays of sets as values :

```json

```

If you want a flat array of sets, you can use `Object.values(sets).flat()` in JavaScript.

Each set object contains :

- `code`: Set code (like "A1"),
- `releaseDate`: Release date of the set,
- `count`: Number of cards in the set,
- `name`: Set name in different languages (Object with language codes as keys, Names as values),
- `packs`: List of packs in the set (Array of strings).

### Example

Here is an example of a card object (`cards.json`):

```json
{
  "set": "A1",
  "number": 1,
  "rarity": "C",
  "image": "cPK_10_000010_00_FUSHIGIDANE_C.webp",
  "name": "Bulbasaur",
  "packs": ["Mewtwo"]
}
```

Here is an example of a card extra object (`cards.extra.json`):

```json
{
  "set": "PROMO-B",
  "number": 11,
  "name": "Eevee",
  "rarity": "R",
  "image": "cPK_90_012660_00_EIEVUI_R.webp",
  "element": "colorless",
  "type": "pokemon",
  "stage": "basic",
  "health": 50,
  "retreatCost": 1,
  "weakness": "fire"
}
```

Here is an example of a set object (`sets.json`):

```json
{
  "code": "A1",
  "releaseDate": "2024-10-30",
  "count": 286,
  "name": {
    "en": "Genetic Apex",
    "fr": "Puissance Génétique",
    "de": "Unschlagbare Gene",
    "zh": "最強的基因",

### Images

If you’re looking for images, you can find them [here](https://github.com/flibustier/pokemon-tcg-exchange/tree/main/public/images/cards) or in [latest release](https://github.com/flibustier/pokemon-tcg-pocket-database/releases/).

Since 2.1.0, you can also use the directory `cards-by-set` which contains images renamed as predictable names, group by set directory :
```
cards-by-set/A1/1.webp
...
cards-by-set/B2a/23.webp
```

To calculate the path, you can simply do `cards-by-set/${card.set}/${card.number}.webp`.
